# Sales-Dashboard-Report-Power-BI-Project-Summary

Hi everyone!
Iâ€™m thrilled to share my Sales Dashboard Report created using Power BI.


This project focuses on analyzing overall sales performance across different regions, categories, and time periods.

I cleaned and transformed the raw dataset, applied filters, and 
created interactive visuals like bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs to show sales trends, profit analysis,
and top-performing products.

The dashboard allows users to filter data by region, product category, and sales representative, 
making it easy to explore detailed insights. I also added KPIs such as total sales, profit margin, and 
order count for quick business performance tracking.

The visuals clearly show how different regions and categories contribute to overall revenue. 
This project helped me enhance my data modeling, DAX, and
visualization skills while building an attractive,
user-friendly dashboard for decision-making.
